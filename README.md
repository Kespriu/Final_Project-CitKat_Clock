## Description

The Citkat clock is a desktop toy in the shape of a Kitcat clock. This desktop toy mimic how a real life KitCat clock works. Its eyes and tail move side to side in a metronome like way. The cat has a clock on it's tummy that tells the time, which is the synced up time from your computer. If you click on the Kats nose you get text options to see either the date or the time. You can return to the main screen for both with the return button. If you click on the Kat's bowtie then a giant clock will appear. You can move and exit out of both the giant clock and the Kat desktop toy and the Kat stay's above any program you open up on your computer. 

In my imports folder I have all of the pixel art that was used during the making of this project and is just of the model of the CitKat clock and all it's little pieces. 

I chose the design of a KitCat as my basis since I own one and I love seeing it all the time. I wanted to make something fun that I could always see on my computer, even if I was in a game or doing something else. As an animation major, I also wanted to make something that was animated without using Pygame or a program that we'd already used as well.
