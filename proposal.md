# Final-Project - CitKat Clock

## Repository


## Features
- Pinned to Screen
  - Pinning and moving the desktop toy/ CitKat clock to the top of your screen over any program. 
- Text Bubbles
  - Dialouge with the clock prompted by clicking on it. Getting choices for interative speech. 
- Belly Clock
  - Pop up of the clock on the CitKat Clocks belly that shows the local time on your computer at all times.  
 
## Challenges
- Learn and read all the possiblites/capabilites of the Tkinter python library, and actually implement in a functinal manner into my own code. 
- Learn how to animate through code and make my desktop toy move and interact with the user. I also to research through what library I could achieve that. 
- Writing code that interacts with the operating system/desktop. 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- To make a desktop toy in the form of a CitKat Clock (with a moustache) that is animated, it's tail and eyes swishing back and forth until it's clicked on. I want it to tell the time through a clock on it's stomach (an analouge clock) and for the time to be the same as the computers local time. I want the Kat to be pinable to your screen and for it to be visible above every program open on your computer. Finally, I want the Kat to have dialouge bubbles appear when clicked on where it's response is differnt depending on where it's clicked on. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- To make a minimally animated CitKat clock desktop toy that can tell you the time, have simple dialouge, and be pinned to your screen. 

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1 - Getting an actual widget on screen and getting it to move around. (Make pixel art of CitKat Clock).
  2. Goal 2 - Getting the desktop toy to be pinned above other applications. 

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1 - Implementing the text bubbles and having them pop up when the Kat is clicked on. 
  2. Goal 2 - Making dialouge options for said text bubbles. 

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Goal 1 - Getting the clock on the Kats Tummy to tell the time and show it in real time through animation. 
  2. Goal 2 - Getting the clock to pop up when clicked on and final touch ups.
